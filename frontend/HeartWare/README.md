Emotional Support for ETH Computer Science Students

## What?

42 hour VISCON-hackathon project, emotional support bot.

## Why?

Life at ETH is hard, and students need a place to pour out their hearts. But sometimes even Lifeline is unavailable, and that is what our bot is for. Knowing some specifics about the hardest CS courses, it may offer emotional and rational advice.

## How?

Hooked up a 7B LLM to a python backend and wrote a nice frontend in Vue.
