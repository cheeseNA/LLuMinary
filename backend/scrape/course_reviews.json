The second part covers different stochastic and sampling methods with some interesting exercises looking at real world applications (Although confusing, it was my favorite part).There's a script and videos covering the content in the course (self study). The exercises consist of written part and programming in jupyter notebook. Some of them are solved/discussed together in class.The end exam was much different/harder than the mock exam questions I used as my main preparation.

It is more of a practical introduction to how to use R than anything else. You won't learn how the algorithms work or why. You only learn what they do (xy fits a squiggly line). The script is very short and probably together with the exercises enough to do well in this class.

    "Large Language Models": [
        "Overall it is an interesting course, but a lot of people took it because they expected to learn ChatGPT stuff and then dropped the course after first theory lectures on measure theory. Prof. Cotterell's content is overlapping with Natural Language Processing and Advanced Formal Language Theory courses a lot and the first (theoretical) assignment requires a lot of time and effort to do. Prof. Cotterell can explain the material very well and in an engaging way, but you are very likely to be confused by relevancy of some topics to LLMs in general, however, it was still interesting to learn stuff that he presented. Prof. Sachan and Prof. Tramer's part is more like you would expect from a course called Large Language Models with focus on LLM architectures, finetuning, prompt engineering and fairness. The second (more practical assignment) is much more useful IMO for further work with LLM's if you ever need to use them. The exam is moderately difficult, but overall the course team is always trying to improve the course and help you if you have questions about content or assignments. The course was happening for the first time ever, so it is likely to change next year, but I would still recommend it.FS23"

The lectures were recorded, so this course could have been followed remotely. The grade consists of one final MC exam on moodle, which is doable when you watched the lectures and did the \"Kontrollfragen\" (which is a short quiz after every lecture on moodle) and maybe revising the slides once or twice. The exam does have a few tricky questions, but many that should be very similar to the semester.FS23"

From the title of this course, I expected a theoretical and math-heavy course, however a big part was actually how to apply the discussed mathematical foundations in practice and accordingly 50% of the grade are from programming exercises. They can be somewhat time-consuming, especially for 5 ECTS, but to me they were really rewarding, since they helped me understand the theory a lot better. The other 50% of the grade are an oral exam, the contents and structure of which are really fair in my opinion. They focus on whether you have an intuitive understanding of the discussed topics and not if you know the formulas by heart.FS23"

    "Game Programming Laboratory": [
        "Good fun, would definitely recommend! Making a project in a team like this was a really cool experience. Only real gripe I have with the course is that we were forced to use the very barebones MonoGame (C# game making framework, i.e. a library of some basic functions like sprite rendering and 3D camera utilities), which we often jokingly referred to as MonoPain. I don't think there was much of a point to having to make everything from scratch like this. While the lecturer might say that this gives us more of an insight into game development, I actually feel quite the opposite. Unless you're an engine programmer, you will likely never have to implement a collision- or particle system from scratch. I would much rather have the focus on... creating the actual gameplay. And I feel like the cool ideas everyone had could have been executed much better if we had the liberty to use an actual game engine.FS23"

The focus is on analyzing and modelling problems and showing that a wild variety of problems essentially come down to matrix factorization. At the same time, CIL does also cover all the usual ML topics such as gradient descent, NNs, CNNs, AEs, GANs, DDPMs etc. The quality of the lectures is okay but the prof also makes it clear that this course is not a priority for him. The projects are recycled every year while making the baseline harder to account for the increase of computational power and advances in ML in the last decade. The projects are okay but they would be a lot more interesting if they reworked them to give some new options to explore.The exam is a mix of an UZH exam and a normal exam. If you want to solve it like a normal exam, you won't have enough time. So make sure to have all the required formulas on the cheat sheet. FS23"

If you're not very familiar with those it might be more challenging. The exam was pretty fair (though you have no practice assignments apart from the slides). The project workload heavily depends on how much you want to invest. If you aim for something up to like a 5.5 it shouldn't be a ton of work but if you aim for a 6 in the project you might have to invest an amount of time that's disproportional to 30% of the 5 credits for the course.HS21"

    "Optimization for Data Science": [
        "This entire course is essentially a course about variations of the gradient descent algorithm and their convergence guarantees in different theoretical scenarios. The course can be interesting from the perspective that most optimization methods are applied without really considering if and how they work. It also uses various mathematical tools that can be somewhat interesting for people who'd like to do more research into similar areas. But for the most part, the course feels quite repetitive and boring. In the last lecture, the prof also tries to shortly bridge the course to the optimization in practise - which essentially shows that a lot of the course content is pretty pointless in practise. The graded assignments are usually quite hard and require a lot of time. Though, the difficulty of the individual tasks does vary a lot. Some of the tasks are also unsolvable until they fix the task description which can easily take a week or more. Overall, this course is quite boring, requires a significant time-investment and does not really feel relevant.FS23"

It wasn't.The content is interesting (finally learning how exactly Fourier Transform works sounds great) but could have been presented in a more engaging way. The lectures felt like a waste of time.Over all the course was much harder more time consuming than I've expected. Complex Analysis requierd more effort than other 4 ECTS courses like probablity and statistics.To end this on a more positive note: there weren't any negative surprises at the exam, it's easy to prepare for the final exam by grinding old exercises and exams. Also you're allowed to bring a cheatsheet.FS23"

I kinda expected that there would be more concrete examples of technologies that are used in companies and why. However this aspect was covered in a series of guest lectures.I'd say  the quality of the lecure slides is very high, you find all the information you need to study for the exam in them. I would recommend attending the lectures not only due to the absence of recordings, but also because they are engaging and there are lots of opportunities to ask questions and get quality answers. The only negative point when it comes to resources is that there are any solutions provided for the exercises.The course isn't too difficult, but I wouldn't say that it's free credits. If you attend the lectures, pay attention, maybe even take notes and solve the exercises during the semester passing the course shouldn't be a problem.Although the content wasn't exactly what I expected, I've gained some insights into the business side of CS (especially during the guest lectures) and I would definitely recommend it, if you're at least somewhat interested in economics.FS23"

The profs did their job quite good, some more exciting, some less.The grading is done by an essay/document of about 10 [+/-5] pages (+ slides you won't be asked to hold) with a group up to 5. Though, they were quite open to stretch any limits. For writing this you only had 12 days, but it shouldn't be too much effort/time depending on what you aim for.

        "While I can say many negative things about AML, I still believe that it gave me a good overview of what ML has to offer. You look at a wide variety of topics. A lot of the topics are similar to IML, however, they are treated a lot less superficially and I learned a lot imo. Furthermore, you actually need to understand (most of) the proofs and they are actually asked in the exam, which I really liked but that is very subjective. Just keep in mind that this course requires a lot of self-study and looking things up online. I did not profit much from attending lectures or exercise classes, but that again is very subjective. The projects are a rat race and are pretty toxic in my opinion since they are graded competitively. If you are a competitive person, willing to spend your weekends/ late nights tuning hyperparameters and searching the internet for new models to add to your ensemble, then you will learn a lot and can do really well in the projects. The knowledge acquired will also translate to other ML courses, Datathons etc. Last year, in the first project you could place very well by just using the CPU nodes on euler. However, in the second project, the top teams used neural networks which could only be properly trained on GPUs, which AML does not give you access to. Even as a person who has access to GPUs, I share the opinion that this is really unfair, but not atypical for ML courses at ETH. Like every ETH ML course, they don't teach you the practical stuff. I recommend that you learn the basics of the bash command line and how to run your ML models on Euler not only for this course but also for your future ML courses, your project teammates and your job.

While I enjoyed attending the lectures in person, I believe reading the slides and watching the recordings if necessary would be very doable in this course. There is a mid term exam after the first half of the semester. The lectures continued after that with guest lecturers, but I opted not to attend them as the content would not be tested anymore.I felt like the exam was quite fair.In addition to the exam there were three graded assignments and a large project which was done in groups of two.The assignments were somewhat time consuming, but extremely easy. They were essentially always structured in a way where you had to follow some README guide and \"use\" some software testing program (gcov, KLEE, and AFL). I say \"use\" in quotes, because you barely had to think for yourself and could mostly just follow the README guides. The most challenging issues were often dependency conflicts or just when something didn't go as described in the README.For the project they suggested a number of topics from which we could select. We were then assigned a supervisor and worked quite independently from there. I found it really interesting to create a software project from scratch with some practical use. I think the amount of work invested into the project will vary quite a lot between different groups.FS23"

    "Informal Methods": [
        "I'll start by saying that I personally did not enjoy the course, but I'll try to give a fair assessment of it.Communication from the prof and teaching staff was poor, one week they were all sick, but didn't bother informing anyone that the lecture was canceled. Maybe a one off, but really rubbed me the wrong way. Then again, for the final assignment they extended the deadline by one week, but only one day after the initial deadline had already passed. This was during HS22.On a positive note, the prof tries to make the lectures quite interactive, lots of interactively solving problems at the blackboard during class.  There are homework assignments (I think more or less weekly) that are not graded, I did not solve those because I was short on time.Then there were three graded assignments and those were quite intensive and I personally had trouble understanding what they expected the answers to look and be like. If you put in the time, they are however quite doable, I ended up skipping the final assignment almost entirely as I had a lot of other things going on when it was due (again, they extended the deadline of that specific assignment by a week. that could have been quite helpful if I had any more time available during that week, which I unfortunately did not).I am unsure if the ungraded homework assignments would have been good preparation for the graded assignments and if they would have made it easier to understand how to formulate answers.As far as the content is concerned, it felt quite tedious. In the end the course teaches you how to carefully analyze some code to proof some desired properties about it or spot bugs in the code; think Hoare triples and invariants.HS22"

The project was a huge amount of work and very hard for me who didn't take any advanced ML courses yet.

The exercise sheets often had unclear questions and were therefore hard to solve. They do not provide old exams because they claim the content changes too much. They have at the same time provided almost the same mock exam as preparation for years. As my second ML course after IML, I had a tough time grasping all the different models introduced. By the time the exam came around the week after the semester I felt quite underprepared, part of that is definitely on me as I should have recognized that earlier, but part of that is also a lack of material to prepare for the exam. I invested significant time into the weekly exercise sheets and as stated often had a hard time with them. The questions on the exercise sheets were often in a different style to those in the mock exam and then also the actual exam.FS23",

It teaches everything from gradient descent, training ML models, NNs, CNNs, RNNs, VAEs, Autoregressive Models, Diffusion Models and Reinforcement Learning. It's quite likely that you've seen all of the content in the other courses - but if you have not, it might be decently interesting to expand your knowledge on ML architectures. The professor does not have time for this course for personal reasons. Unfortunately, this reflects in the poor quality of the lectures and the material in general. Some of the lecturers are okay though. But the lectures generally have a lot of pictures/videos and not much value in terms of actual content. While I do appreciate them showing the practical results, they really only touch all topics superficially and are unable to elaborate on in-depth questions when asked.The exam is feasible but it's not really about understanding the topics.

Also, the assessment was 3 exams during the semester, with no exam session exams. However, the support from the lecturers and TAs are lacking. The TAs were not well prepared (there is only 1 exercise class) and the material given to prepare for the exams was minimal and not reflective of the difficulty of the exam. The structure of the course was also questionable but not not understandable.Still the course is graded very liniently, and is very chill overall. FS23",
        "Disclaimer: This course was offered for the first time when I took it. Most likely, there will be some changes made.This is an introductory information theory course, meaning you will learn about concepts such as information, entropy, and channels. All these concepts rely on probability theory and statistics. So if you don't like probability or don't feel comfortable working with them the lecture could be confusing sometimes. However, you rarely need advanced concepts. The course is more a broad overview than a formal introduction. Proofs are often rather handwavy and vague.Professor Hofmann is a great lecturer and seems to enjoy teaching the course. The main problem with the lecture is the exercise sheets and their solutions. Over the semester there are three exercise sheets, one for every exam during the semester. The solutions often contained a lot of mistakes and the exercises sometimes used confusing notation that wasn't used in the lecture/script.During the semester there are three exams that are rather calculation heavy and don't ask more high-level questions. I didn't expect this, so I was surprised during the first exam. The grading however was really generous. There is also the option of writing a short paper (2-3 pages). The final grade is the average of the three best results out of the three exams and the term paper. Overall, I would recommend the course if you're looking for an introductory information theory course. The only downsides are the exercise sheets and maybe the exercise sessions in general.  FS23"

In my year we had a big ethical focus and talked about AI although it isn't the main topic of the course.Presentation topics can be chosen based on papers provided by the prof and you might also choose own topics - if the prof approves it.The workload isn't that high, but you should still invest some time in the mandatory presentation.At the beginning of the semester I wasn't that interested in the topics, but it turned out to be ok in the end.

The main organizer Dr. Lukas Gudmundsson is IMO quite a boring lecturer. However, he only teaches 3 out of the 12 weeks. The rest are usually specialized speakers who talk about their own field of research which was often very interesting. While the type of content can be quite new for people like me with a much more technical background (compared to the USYS students next to you), the amount of work for the 2 semester exams is similar to that of an average GESS subject and therefore more than fair for the 3KP in a non-GESS category.

It lies right in the spot between practice and theory, where the theory isn't interesting enough on its own but isn't practical enough for me to pay attention to. Additionally, the teaching could be better. Dr. Bugariu did a decent job but had to teach the most tedious parts. Dr. Schwerhoff was a great lecturer, and I really enjoyed his part. However, the parts Prof. Vechev taught I did not enjoy at all. He is funny, but his teaching is often incoherent and extremely hard to follow. This is a problem, because he teaches the most important part of the lecture.Additionally, he randomly picks students to answer his questions and often asks the same student for the entirety of the lecture, which seems rather mean. The project only has something to do with the lectures in theory, because the parts explained in the class are already implemented by the various poorly documented libraries. Thus, the project is more about figuring out how to put the libraries together. Maybe this is supposed to be the software engineering part. The exercises prepare you for the exam, so solving them during the semester is worth it. I only attended two exercise sessions, but visiting them might be worth it.FS23",

        "The course was a week of mandatory attendance for 2 credits. We dived into how AI is being used to create texts and art and how this plays a role morally. At the end of the week we had to hold a presentation about some concept we had to come up with. But I feel like nobody really knew what they were on about and just mentioned some buzzwords.For the amount of effort and the credits it gives, I find it is very worth. There was even a big queue to get in. But for the content itself it's not very scientific and more conceptually focused.FS23",
        "This course is basically a one week back to school experience. Basically 0 workload and relaxed setting.3 days \u00e0 6h of lecture where only attendance counts. Last day is about 3h of group work and 3h of presentations. To be honest, most students didnt pay attention at all and merely focused on doing other subject's HW. The course in itself is rather interesting albeit disengaging. Probably the easiest 2 credits one could get.But beware that you'll miss 4 days worth of the other subjects so enroll with care.",
        "If you are just looking for credits this is likely the easiest two credits you are ever going to get. The content has a not insignificant focus on art, which to me was not really interesting. However the AI topics are mostly interesting, but focused on ethical aspects.Generally the topics seem drawn out as if they were struggling to fill the time. Time wise its 4 days from 10-5 with a one hour lunch break and a few shorter breaks scattered throughout.The final project was pretty cool as you get to explore basically anything that appeals to you as long as its roughly within the bounds of AI and bias.If they implement the feedback they got, such as people from industry presenting their opinion and making it more interactive, the course would be even better and more engaging then it is now.FS23",
        "Its 4 days and about 6h each day where one has to be there. As for effort you wont find anywhere at ETH a course giving better ECTS/workload ratio.At times the lectures lose the \"roter faden\" but they are actively trying to improve on it for next year. Also the style is more relaxed like in a school which at times is nice to have not something fast paced.At the end of the day there are still a few things one can take away from this course even if one isnt working much with AI in general.So yea if you need 2 ECTS in your planning this is the course to go."

The professor is very competent and a good presenter.There is a \"Disskussionsforum\": In a first part, everyone has to hand in a short essay about a thesis. In the second part you will have to write a response to an essay.There is a written exam at the end. The questions are open and similar to those in the Disskussionsforum."

    "Natural Language Processing for Law and Social Science": [
        "While the course is offered as an elective or GESS course for BSc in computer science, the lecturer announced during the first week that the course is intended for a MSc or PhD level. This left a sour taste from the beginning. There are weekly assignments that are quite time consuming, and the coding templates (Jupyter notebooks) had quite a few dependency conflicts despite there being a \"requirements.txt\" file that should install all the correct dependencies. When I took the course it was offered both in person and through Zoom. Due to frequent technical issues, mainly sound related, the Zoom experience was a lot worse than the in person one. Attendance is required for this course, which adds to the high time commitment. The lecturer \"offers\" additional assignments if one has to miss a lot of lectures. Besides the weekly assignments, students have to write a few essays throughout the semester, which include submitting a draft, peer grading other essays, and reworking the draft based on feedback from other students. At the end of the semester there is a take home test.As a positive the course show cases a lot of natural language processing tools and libraries. The coding assignments can be done without much prior NLP knowledge, but this might have contributed to my assessment of the workload being way too high."

    "Time Series Analysis": [
        "This is a typical math course. Sometimes it was hard to understand why we were proving certain things or what those theorems were actually useful for. However Prof. Meinshausen is a good lecturer and he also did some examples in R.During the semester there were only two exercise sheets and one page of a previous exam. This made it really difficult to prepare for the exam. And was definitely not enough.The exam is multiple choice and there were no negative points. The first three exercises (roughly 40% of the exam) were really straightforward. Because of the structure of the exam passing was not very difficult.HS22"

    "Fundamentals of Mathematical Statistics": [
        "I took the course because I liked the course Probability and Statistics in the computer science bachelor and wanted to deepen my knowledge in this area. From what I've heard, the people taking this course are from the mathematics bachelor, the statistics master or the data science master. This means the course has students from multiple backgrounds and therefore the mathematical content is not completely rigorous. However, in many instances I felt really lost, because in order to understand the proofs fully, I would have needed a much bigger background knowledge in probability theory and/or even measure theory. Teaching StaffI only attended one exercise class (was not that helpful). Therefore I cannot say anything about how good the TAs are at explaining the content if you ask them directly about it. The TAs were not responding to any of my emails, which is not appropriate in my opinion. ResourcesThe course has a script which contains almost everything about the lecture. Some proofs where written down on the black board a little bit more detailed in the lecture than in the script. Even though the script covers everything, the proofs were hard to follow because in their derivation not every step follows from the preceding one. This meant I had to fill the holes myself and this made me more unsure, if I really understood the argument (this is where a strong probability background would have helped a lot). Exam TipsThe script is your friend! Try to understand everything the professor wrote down as being exam relevant and make sure you can actually write down the derivation of the proofs and the examples. The exam always has six exercises and three of them where actually not that hard to solve in my opinion. These include the topics about exponential families, UMVU estimators, testing theory and the linear model. If you want to pass the course without much effort, you should try to be able to solve these exercises. On the other hand, to achieve a very good grade you probably need to be able to memorize most of the proofs + examples from the script.TLDRInteresting content, but requires a strong background in probability theory/measure theory to understand everything. Teaching Assistants did not respond to any of my emails and the prof made a mediocre job at explaining the content. The exam is doable and graded nicely. "

I cannot say much about the lectures themselves since I almost never attended them due to them being the only course on that day, I studied with the lecture notes and my ta's notes.There is a lecture script (the mentioned lecture notes) which is sometimes a bit hard to understand, it is not written very intuitive. Exercises are definitely exam relevant and the later ones took up to 2 hours for me, but they are useful to help you understand stuff. there are no old exams published besides a mock exam, but in one of the few lectures I watched, Iacobelli (lecturer) mentioned the exercises/mock exam are what is asked in the exam. the exam itself this year was long this year (at least for me), I got through most of the exercises in the 3 hours without going through anything twice. You can take a cheat sheet without any exercises of the course and a specified book for the exam"

I just wanted to add that sometimes when seeing the solutions of the minitest and hearing the prof's explanations I was still not at all convinced of the solution. I.e. some questions seemed to me as if one could argue both cases but the prof decided that one side was correct and that's the answer that gave points.HS22",
        "The course is very light on workload and near imposible to fail if even a little bit of time is spend (Way less than 3 ECTS). Course content is somewhat interesting, however the course structure could be done better. For example before each lecture there is a graded miniquiz which is about the content that had to be read beforehand and will be discussed in the lecture. This way however the lecture often felt obsolete.Also whats nice the course only runns for 1/2 of a semester (about 7 weeks).PS: Be carefull the Prof tried to sell the script to ETH students for 50.- without any mention about it in Mystudies/VVZ which is legaly binding and against ETH regulation."

    "Computer Vision": [
        "The coursework projects are very interesting, but I especially recommend watching the lectures and supplementing with outside resources, as it can be quite hard to learn from some of the slides. For Marc Pollefeys' content (taught in lectures 10-13), the slides were largely formulae with little to no explanation. To actually understand his slides, you also need to study a few hundred pages of a dense textbook about multiple view geometry. Said textbook was the basis of those slides. Some of Fisher Yu's slides, particularly those which are just images, could also do with more written explanation. I have no issues with Siyu Tang's slides and enjoyed them very much. There are 6 assignments, most of which have 2 weeks to complete. Keep this in mind. The exam in January 2023 also seemed (at least from my perspective) much harder compared to previous exams. Fortunately, I still passed. Would I recommend it? If you are truly interested in computer vision, yes. However, it is a challenging course to say the least. "

    "Algorithms Lab": [
        "Algolab is a very enjoyable course. The entire course consists of implementing code that solves some problems. The setup is essentially the same as with A&D and A&W programming tasks. Algolab does NOT depend on APC. I invested roughly 75 hours to solve the exercises during the semester. When adding the time spent on the tutorials, assessments, exam preparation and the exam, it took me slightly less than 120 hours which corresponds to 4 credits. Solving the exercises was very fun. It is occasionally challenging but as you have a lot \"small\" tasks and not a small number of large projects, the positive feelings when completing a task dominate the overall sentiment. This is generally great; you can just sit down for a couple of hours and really see the progress. When people talk about  Algolab, you often hear a lot of negative stuff (especially from people who didn't take Algolab). One such topic is C++. I did not know any C++ beyond what I've \"learnt\" in NumCSE. Wasn't an issue at all. Another thing is the exam being 2x5 hours. People talk about this as if it was a threat - but it's actually the other way around: They offer you a lot of time so you can solve the tasks instead of forcing you to race through the exam and hope for the best. Furthermore, one third of the exam consists of problems you have solved before and the passing grade is at roughly 40%... so you basically get a passing grade for free. So overall, I would really say that it's one of the best courses there is.HS22"

E.g. instead of Rust ownership, the lecturer comes up with his own (lacking) type system and then operates inside these rules. However, all in all the exercises are interesting, the tutorial sessions have been great, the lecture has actually good slides to look at independently (that's unusual for ETH. But in turn there are no livestreams nor recordings...), and the lecture itself is slow and low on content but the lecturer is mostly successfully trying to be funny by mocking programming languages.I would have wished for more context about why language designers make their decisions and more weird things for existing real programming languages.

But to me it felt like a lot of different things were covered but many things were only touched superficially and there's many similar but different things that one needs to keep track of. While many concepts are definitely interesting, there was just too much jumping around.

So the entire course focuses on the \"probabilistic method\" which allows proving (non-probabilistic) statements using probabilistic objects.

    "Randomized Algorithms and Probabilistic Methods": [
        "tl;dr; many students say this course is the best course of the Theoretical Computer Science major.Content:The majority of the course is spent on probabilistic methods - so on analyzing probabilistic properties. This does include algorithms but also many other things. Random graphs are also a major topic of this part.Another topic of this course is Markov Chains. This might also be the only course where you get a proper introduction to Markov Chains in case you haven't really seen them before. Depending on how far you get, you might also cover Generating functions and some other fancy stuff. Prof. Steger talked about the most interesting stuff after the exam content cutoff so I strongly recommend still visiting those lectures.Some things are extremely interesting and might also be useful in practise. But most tool taught in this course are probably more relevant if you want to go into research in a related area.Prerequisites:This course softly expects that you have some basic understanding of asymptotic analysis, probability theory and randomized algorithms as taught by the bachelor level course \"Algorithms and Probability\" (A&W). It does not depend on \"Algorithms, Probability & Computing\" (APC) at all. The RAPM script is complete and Prof. Steger will not strictly assume that you took A&W so it's also no issue if you haven't seen certain things before.Structure:This course is quite similar to APC in many regards. The homework and the graded assignments are quite similar in terms of structure and difficulty. But as it's only one lecturer and as the topics are a bit more coherent, it's maybe a bit easier to make progress on tasks. Overall:Prof. Steger is one of the best professors of the department so the lectures are extremely enjoyable. Many of the topics may not seem very interesting at first but I still think that this course is quite interesting. The tasks can be quite difficult and the effort can also be a bit unbalanced but if it doesn't clash too much with other courses, that should still work out. Also, we got chocolate at the exam.HS22"

He's also pretty laid back when it comes to deadlines (I submitted most assignments 1-2 weeks late) because he's also behind his own deadlines.You need to invest quite some time, but I think it's just about fair for 4 ECTS. The assignments aren't \"hard\" per se, but require lots of simulation and visualization.

Almost nobody does this though.",

However this course, it is a two edged sword: On the one hand if you're interested in the topic, the lecture can be fun and the lecturer will be available for questions during lectures and per Mail. On the other hand be prepared to spend way too many hours (and/or days) on the assignments which count to the final grade. The credit to work ratio is not balanced in my opinion (the lecturer seems to be aware of it). Although I don't think the content is hard per se, the assignments are sometimes unclear and require own research and guessing what the lecturer expects. The assignments assume that you have (practical) statistic knowledge. Knowing how to interpret, visualize and evaluate statistical data (performance measurements) is not really tought but required in this course. Matlab knowledge is very beneficial.Despite these negative points, a pro is that you will gain practical insights e.g. by working with Arduinos or doing simulations. The later assignments are more practical and more fun.To conclude, I would only recommend this course if you are truly interested and don't mind spending a lot of time on the assignments. If you're only taking it to pass, there are probably other courses needing less effort."

It\u2019s not a lot of effort but you just need to make sure that you do it. This course was carried by D-INFK but I believe the course now is carried by D-GESS with a different course number.HS19"

    "Introduction to Game Theory": [
        "This block course is just a quick pass through some game theory content. The lecturers are nice, the lectures are decent and following the course easy. There are two major points to consider before taking this course:- It is a block course, so it might overlap with some other lessons. Whether that\u2019s an issue or not depends a bit on the current format.- Writing the mini-thesis about some topic can be quite some effort. You\u2019re free to choose any topic you like but even then it\u2019s quite time consuming. So you might have to invest some time in the off-hours or in the beginning of the semester break.Overall, this course is somewhere between okay and good. There\u2019s no major pain points and the course is generally enjoyable. But it is just a low-credit course so don\u2019t expect some deep insights into Game Theory.FS20"

    "Pluralist Philosophy of Mathematics": [
        "The course consists of 12 readings with ~20 pages per reading. Each reading comes with a few questions, out of which you can choose one and write a mini-essay answering the question (500-750 words). In total, you have to submit 4-5 mini-essays during the semester, out of which the best 4 will count towards your grade. Moreover, for each reading, you may submit comments/questions about particular parts of the reading, over the website perusall.com. These are not graded, but you have to do this for at least 8 readings, with at least 5 comments per reading. Another requirement to pass the course is that you should \"submit something\", i.e. either a perusall assignment or a mini-essay, in 10 different weeks, to prevent \"speedrunning\". The course covers many different mathematical philosophies, such as realism, naturalism, constructivism, structuralism, formalism, with respect to pluralism. I personally found it more interesting than I thought it would be. The workload is not particularly high, and grading is rather generous. The lectures are devoted to discussions about the readings, and you can use the discussed things in your mini-essays, but it is not necessary to do so (although they encourage people to come to class). ",
        "\u2022 Cleanly organised, pretty much all relevant material comes from a single book. Lectures were only mildly helpful.\u2022 Workload is very fair and consists of leaving comments/questions on weekly reading assignments and submitting a handful of 1-page essays. The text excerpts can occasionally get a little hard to understand but having an interest in thinking about the nature of math (e.g. \"math is invented vs. math is discovered\") makes it more enjoyable.\u2022 Essay grading was quite generous.Good math philosophy course overall."

    "Algorithms, Probability, and Computing": [
        "APC is an extremely interesting course that builds on top of A&D and A&W (and maybe also LinAlg, DiskMat and PProg). The course is purely theoretical and you will not have to implement anything. Compared to A&D and A&W it is significantly harder. Doing this course together with a smallish and active study group would help a lot. APC consists of six disjoint chapters which means that there are \u201cbackup topics\u201d if you\u2019re completely lost in one of them. There are two sets of graded homework - expect to spend a lot of time on solving them and writing them down. Unlike with A&D and A&W, solving APC tasks is extremely hard meaning that you often understand what the task wants but you cannot find any attack vector to make any progress. This is extremely frustrating and together with the very theoretical topics, this can be very straining. Doing APC is recommended if you want to write a thesis in the theoretical CS section (complexity theory, algorithms etc.) or if you want to continue your master in that direction. I think it\u2019s very hard to give a simple, summarising judgement for this course; it is very interesting but it also is very hard. So: Go into the course too fast, the course eats you!HS20"

While this probably would deter a few people, it is actually rather interesting.You can improve your grade with an optional project, which I myself have not done, but I hear that its most likely not worth the effort. You only get all the bonus or nothing. While they eventually provided tests it was still uncertain if they cover all edge cases. I guess we will see after pr\u00fcfungseinsicht how much the tests helped.HS22",

On the one hand, there\u2019s a decent chance that you find some topics interesting. On the other hand, you might also dislike many of them. I personally felt like the first part contained virtually no tangible content. The second part did cover many interesting topics and while they do technically have some common theme, the second part does feel somewhat chaotic. The parts that are covered a bit more in-depth are hard to follow because the various problems and solutions often only differ little and thus it\u2019s easy to confuse things. And other parts are just about completely different dimensions of a related topic which sometimes just feels weird.The exercises are unfortunately mostly pointless. And fortunately, this course doesn\u2019t have any prerequisites. But overall, I can recommend following the lectures in the semester and then just preparing for the exam. HS20"

You get to do a lot of programming in the projects and the content is surprisingly interesting and not very math heavy. It's very nice to have 50% of the grade in beforehand but it is a lot of effort to get the projects done.",
        "The course wants to take a lot of your attention, especially with the projects. The good thing is, if you do put a lot of effort into the projects, you learn an immense amount and the projects and lectures synergize quite well (thought frustratingly the lectures are always far ahead of the projects).Professor was very nice and seemed to geniuenly care about the students, sadly the actual excitement in the lectures was quite low for me. The content gets interesting after finally understanding it.",
        "Very interesting course and teaches you a lot of how compilers work. 50% of your grade is based on bi-weekly projects in OCaml that take quite a bit of work, but not so much that I'd consider it *too* much. Many of the lectures towards the end are usually not exam relevant, so after you're done with the projects you can enjoy some neat tidbits from the world of compilers. Would recommend for anyone interested in compilers or coding in general, with the caveat of being aware that it'll be quite a bit of work during the semester (in exchange for an easier Lernphase)",
        "Overall this course is not too interesting and it does require some effort but quite enjoyable anyway. The lectures aren\u2019t particularly interesting - the course is mostly just working through the various layers of a compiler. For most parts of the content, it\u2019s really just a \u201cworking through\u201d the steps as most steps follow quite directly without any special insight or tricks. The more interesting topics such as parsing and optimization make out only a small part of the course. But following the lectures/exercises does not require any extra effort.The only extra effort required is to be spent on the six projects. They take increasingly more time. The first one might take an hour or two. The later ones might also require more; though, likely somewhere between 5 and 20. The projects are coding projects in OCaml. The biggest hurdle to OCaml is setting up the environment - after that, your Haskell experiences should cover for the rest. OCaml is even more flexible than Haskell so you technically have more freedom if you\u2019re not a friend of the pure functional programming style of Haskell. Another challenge is often understanding the code template you get. Other than that, the projects technically wouldn't be that hard.Having done FMFP definitely helps as many relevant concepts are also part of FMFP, inference trees also show up and having a fundamental understanding of functional programming will help with solving the projects.As the project counts for 50% of the grade (and is basically always more or less a 6) and as the exams aren\u2019t too hard either, most people get very good grades in this course. And in fact, it has a 100% passing rate almost every year. HS20"

The material is presented in a clear and interesting way. The TAs were as well very helpful. The additional script was useful.However, I would only recommend the course to people who have a strong interest in NLP. Otherwise, the coursework is too much work for 7 credits.  Some assignments had tasks which were badly phrased/confusing and it was sometimes hard to tell if a particular task is badly phrased or if it simply required more work.A large part of the exam is the exact same word-for-word as tasks from the assignments. The lecturer justified the assignments as being so demanding with that. That is a double-edged sword because of the grading-on-a-curve policy: On the one hand, if you put in the work you are guaranteed to get a decent mark. On the other hand, most other people will know how to answer the assignment questions just as well, which makes it harder to get a high mark.",
        "The Course Contents are very interesting, the script is great and this semester the TA's I interacted with were very motivated.However it feels not very planned out especially in the design of the exercises. They are published early and way too much work. Each takes in my experience about as much as all exercises of AML or PAI combined. A small subtask of Task 2 is a full project in ASL. If you start early you risk doing too much, as in some tasks they were later changed to be made easier. But you can not really do that because it is graded and you could end up starting too late.All in all if you want to learn NLP, really really bad and having nothing else to do the whole semester then I'd recommend it. Otherwise, use the publicly available script and other courses to study it.The exercises are tedious, not difficult, thus IMHO they do not create so much extra value in understanding that it is justified spending that much time on a 7 credit course.",

The exam was on Moodle and there was no exam review. For the exam you need to learn stuff by heart and be able to do simple eigenvectors math.

The material seemed too hard and wasn\u2019t really explained. Only after some time I realised that I don\u2019t have to understand this, I just have to get my project done and saw lectures as cool complicated thing without trying to understand it. About the project: you have to make a group with up to 5 people (iirc) and then choose a topic and a tool. For example, my team chose pandemic as topic and reinforcement learning as tool. So we had to do an RL model about pandemics and then write a report about it and do a 15min presentation. All lectures are split into several parts, so lectures on RL were in November, so I just skipped a bunch of lectures and then only watched those which were related to our project. I got into a really good team, where all people were master students in Bio engineering. BTW a majority of people who was taking this course was either master or phd students. Only some Bachelors were there, so I cannot recommend this course for you if you want to take an easy course. Profs were ok but I\u2019ve seen better ones.

Even well-seasoned UX enthusiasts will find something new or interesting in it. (I\u2019d like to highlight that this course does NOT compare to the HCI Cognition GESS course!)The project(s) are probably the most hands-on you\u2019ll go during your studies (when it comes to app development) and (at least in HS22) pretty open-ended.

Its mostly about remembering facts and definitions from the lecture (including quotes) and what to use for certain tasks.Note that in HS22 there were also some calculation questions which were not part of the mock exam. The mock exam is also your only point of reference for what the exam is going to look like.HS22",

The project is done in groups, so if you already have a pre-made group (5-6 people usually) that is advantageous (else you're probably just gonna end up in a random group which is also fine of course). The lectures i visited were quite interactive. The exam was rather predictable and is learning by heart."

This was the highlight of the course as he could give insight to how this Laboratory works and how political it can be. He also showed pictures of his mission in Syria investigating poison gas attacks.Otherwise the lectures felt a bit incoherent and boring at times. This was mostly due to having lots of different lecturers.The exam was a 1.5h or 2h written exam with 6-8 questions which had to be answered with prose. It was a fair exam and if you're at least somewhat interested in international politics and read up on the news and can connect that knowledge with concepts introduced in lecture, you'll do fine in the exams.

    "Information Retrieval": [
        "I took this course in FS2023 held by Dr. Ghishlain Fourny. The lecturer is great, you can check out his youtube channel where he uploads all his lectures to get a first impression. The recordings are even marked by chapters. If you don't like watching lectures you can also just read a book instead. Doing either should suffice to pass after doing a few practice exams. The book is available for free as a pdf to ETH students. The content is easy to understand and the exams are rather straightforward for ETH standards. Generally speaking, I can recommend the course if you're somewhat interested in the material. But I feel like the course is a bit overhyped. Yes, it's a solid course but I personally wouldn't recommend choosing it over another course you are more interested in or is more relevant to the direction you might want to go into. In hindsight, I slightly regret taking this course over other courses I would've been more interested in. However, if you just want credits, or you want to learn about the topics covered in this course, it's definitely a great choice.",
        "I'm in the minority to say this but I didn't find the lecture to be particularly interesting. The material is presented more on the level of \"this is the idea\" without going into great detail and with a lot of simplifications. Some things that (to me atleast) seem very simple are explained 2-3 times which causes me to divert my attention during the lecture (even though I agree with others that Fourny is a very good speaker) and lose focus when then a more challenging topic is covered. I haven't done the exam yet but from the exercises and looking at a few old test questions it seems to be more about having memorized certain facts and computation, which I don't like so much.FS23",

        "This course is essentially an introduction to building a search engine that can find relevant words or subwords in an unstructured text - all without ML even though it could be plugged in at various stages. Fourny is one of the best lecturers of the department (and maybe he will eventually get the Prof title he deserves) so the lectures are well-structured, easy to follow and overall enjoyable. The course content is also interesting and might be a good taster if you\u2019re considering going into the data management systems direction later on. The exercises are a mix of programming (Python) and theory. They aren\u2019t that hard but calculating things is the central topic in both the exercises and the exam. That\u2019s maybe not ideal but passing the exam is very feasible as well. This course doesn\u2019t really have any prerequisites. It might help if you know the basics of Python. It\u2019s a course that could also be taken early on in the bachelor's. Overall, I can definitely strongly recommend this course to everybody.FS21",

It would probably be possible to pass the course without going to the lectures and only reading the book, however I think it's worth attending the lecture because prof Fourny puts a lot of effort into making the lecture interactive.The exercises aren't really necessary to pass the exam, but they are worth solving if you want to apply the concepts learned. The exam isn't too difficult, but time might be an issue.FS22",

    "Introduction to Machine Learning": [
        "Projects were the highlight and very interesting, lectures were fine. The subject matter by itself is very cool but it requires you to be very comfortable in linear algebra, higher level differentiation and probabilities.FS23",
        "This course serves as an introduction to (the theory behind) machine learning. As machine learning is a big part of modern CS, this course is extremely relevant for most students. Furthermore, many theses include ML in one way or another so it\u2019s not uncommon to do IML in the 4th semester or the thesis in the 7th semester. Though, IML can also be done in parallel to a ML thesis.IML itself builds on multivariate analysis and probability theory. Many students have never learnt how to get multivariate gradients and derivatives in practise but you can easily learn that by yourself or by asking someone who knows one of the four methods. Many students don\u2019t even care about it and pass IML without ever learning it but I highly recommend exploring this before or during the course.The course itself is somewhat controversial. Some people love it, some don\u2019t like it. I think that it\u2019s a decent introduction to ML but it mostly focuses on the theoretical foundations so if you want to use it practically, you have to put some work into it yourself (and I would recommend doing so). And this is also reflected in the projects. You are relatively free to use whatever you want but they (and I) highly recommend using Python, Sklearn and Pytorch (TensorFlow, Keras etc. definitely work too). I personally did the project without almost no prior Python experience and without having used any of those libraries before. The projects vary a bit over the years and the difficulty and effort required is also quite different from project to project. The time required to do a project can be anywhere in the single or double digit hours - if you\u2019re used to this kind of trial & error programming and have a good idea where the issues are and have ideas how to address them, you can be extremely fast with solving the projects. If this is not the case, you might lose a lot of time. In fact, if your skills are somewhat limited, you may also lose a lot of time by exploring suboptimal approaches or bad hyperparameters with extremely bad performance - so it takes a couple of hours to see that your program is not good enough. In other words, the projects be done quickly but they can also be extremely time-consuming and as they are quite unguided, it might be hard to make progress without any help. I personally solved them all on my own without asking for help, using task-specific tutorials or anything. The exercise sessions do give some basic introduction to Python and PyTorch. Otherwise, they are mostly like lectures that introduce more content.Most people tend to get good project grades and as the exam is multiple choice, the course is relatively easy to pass. Though, make sure that you understand how their exam papers work.FS21",
        "The lectures were very theoretical and focused a lot on the mathematical aspects of machine learning. I don't think this is a good way to introduce the topics, some more practical knowledge and examples would have been great.The projects are the practical part of the course. They can be a fun and interesting learning opportunity. They often aren't related to what is currently taught in the lectures. The projects can be very challenging and time consuming, even more so when you have little or no experience with machine learning and python. I would recommend solving them in groups.The exam is multiple choice and rather easy compared to the projects.FS22",
        "This course is probably the most interesting course in the whole BSC. You will gain a pretty good mathematical overview over the whole ML topic. However we didn't learn anything about reinforcement learning sadly.The homework tasks and exams are quite hard in the beginning. Even more so since the tasks have mistakes in them (most of the time). But with some practice the exam is quite doable. Additionally you have to keep in mind that you will get 30% of your grade from the projects.The projects are very fun. Sadly the lecture doesn't really focus on how to do them so you are on your own for the most part. There were two baselines - one for public and one for private - against which your submitted predictions were tested. To get all the points you have to be better than both baselines. Most of the time this is very easily doable. Project 3 had pretty hard baselines imo tho. Depending on your knowledge on the matter the projects can take anywhere from 1h to like 2 days. Additionally it can be a pain to train if you dont have a gpu. (you essentially have to do it online..)All in all I would highly recommend the course. ",
        "The lecture was quite mathematical at times, which is not inherently bad, but sadly it often came in place of teaching practical and intuitive knowledge that would have helped with the projects. The projects are fun and interesting, though they can be demanding, especially without prior python/ml knowledge.",
        "For a course that is called introduction to machine learning, it focuses very little on introduction parts. Most of the topics cover the mathematical aspects of machine learning, which are obviously not irrelevant but at times feel like they should not be in the scope of an introductory course.You hardly get anything tought about the practical aspects, as in implementing and setting up a machine learing model for the graded projects.Here you are mostly on your own (or as your group) and have to figure stuff out by yourself. This can at times be really frustrating and time consuming as it often comes down to trial and error which based on your approach can take a long time to go through all the steps.There were a few tutorial sessions where they gave us a brief overview of functions and how to use them, which was nice, however it was rather late in the course and only after people were struggling with a previous project.FS22"

It is rather heavy on reading, reading comprehension, and (partially philosophical) essay writing, where it is crucial to have understood the texts and know the context(s) of the weekly topics in order to get a decent grade.

Among all those texts, one needs to choose a few of them to write essays on. A choice of essay topics for every text is provided. In their grading they really value completeness, so beware of that when writing your essays, they are looking for summary-esque texts over creative interpretations. If you want very low effort and/or don't like writing essays, this is probably not quite the course for you.",

In HS20, ~70% of the points got you the 6.One little advice regarding the exam (as long as they are doing it the same way as in HS20): They are only interested in the result, and it is possible to solve all the questions without using the \"Big Data tools\" learned in the lectures.

The subject is mainly talking about politics and is not significantly related to the technical part of cybersecurity. The only scratch we had with technical stuff was the second lecture talking a little bit about the CIA (Confidentiality, integrity, and availability). The rest was analyzing incidents that were affected by the cyberattacks (Zero-days, hackers invading some systems and what kind of consequences we can have, what type of political movement can be created if cyberattacks occur, etc.) concluding from them. During the semester, there are two assignments to do to be eligible for the exam. One was an assignment submitting a report on a film we had to watch. The second assignment was a group assignment, and you had to finish one intelligence report and a policy response with your group. Every attendee would be divided into a group of 4, discussing policy response to some make-up incident (e.g., I had the problem with hackers hacking into hospitals with the database. You're a member of EU, what should you do, etc.). The open book exam lasted 1h30min and was separated into a single-choice, multiple-choice, and text form, similar to an exam in Kanti because the questions are written in german. Questions are not very hard to solve but require some understanding of the literature provided in the course. Without them, it is also possible to pass (merge all literature into a single pdf and ctrl + f). If you're interested in politics and why cybersecurity is essential based on politics, I'd recommend taking the course. "

Aight then I have a question for you....\"And then there is a paper that you have to present (which you can choose which one you'd prefer to present at the beginning of the seminar).I found the papers quite difficult tbh, they assume you have quite good knowledge about Machine Learning and they throw stuff and formulas at you that they think are obvious but I had lots of trouble understanding it.Nonetheless it is doable, you just once have to invest some time to really understand what the paper is about and do a good presentation on it. You also have an assignt expert that can help you if you have questions etc. Mine was very helpful, we went through the presentation together and made sure I understood everything I talked about.All in all 7/10 would do it again."

You have to do some self-study over a few topics related to teaching and then write about what you learned in various forums. You also have to peer-visit another TA and give them feedback, which I found really useful. Finally there's an afternoon-long wrapup session which consists of you \"teaching\" things to others they probably already know and otherwise not doing much.HS21"

At the beginning I was under the impression that they were required. The complexity of the readings combined with their length I eventually stopped reading them altogether. It turned out that they weren't really important for the exam after all. For the most part the necessary information was on the slides. The policy side of the course was a lot easier to understand and follow. The exam was in person during the first week after the semester on Moodle and had a variety of multiple choice and text answer questions."

    "Shape Modeling and Geometry Processing": [
        "== Format ==I took the course in 2022, so don't know my final grade yet. It is a semester-only course with graded assignments. The grading was done manually, as far as I can tell, and they looked at the submissions in more detail than I would have thought possible and gave feedback on the conceptual mistakes apparent in the code.I find it generally hard to tell in graded assignments at which point it is safe enough to stop polishing it (or maybe safe enough to skip some tasks that don't work after days of debugging) for a reasonable grade. This was also the case in this lecture. So I spent every two weeks roughly one week on the Shape Modelling lecture alone. Apart from the time requirement and the being stuck for hours debugging the same error, the assignments were fun and generally applicable.== Content ==The topics were new to me and not covered in the Bachelors. I could draw some knowledge from the Mathematical Foundations in CG lecture but that is imo not required at all.We had to use libigl, an ETH-maintained c++ library - and not even the latest version of it. There were bugs in that library that caused wrong behaviour and failure to compile. Building it correctly on windows was tricky. The library is also not well-documented and several times I wished I had read their source code from the start instead of relying on the comments in the header file.Topics of the assignments were:* Shading* Implicit Surfaces from Point Clouds* Mesh Smoothing* Parametrizing Meshes, Distortion of Textures* Deforming a mesh by moving the handles around* Skeletal Animation"

The work on these studies was done in rather large groups (I was in a group of 6 people). The case studies are 30% of the grade. The other 70% coming from the exam. The case studies didn't require too much work for a good grade. As preparation for the exam, reading the slides once was more than enough."

    "Introduction to Neuroinformatics": [
        "The course is pretty unrelated to anything. While certain stuff is incredibly interesting, most stuff is simply not applicable to anything. Some stuff is actually quite hard to follow imo. They assume you know quite a bit about physics and circuits already and don't teach you too much about that. However for the most part they will simply scratch the surface of certain topics. This can be kinda frustrating, because you don't really understand a thing. Also don't ignore that this course is pretty much 50% biology. This means looking at how stuff works BUT ALSO looking at how stuff is called which is incredibly boring.The workload in the semester is basically non-existent (for 6 credits...). Only 2hours of lecture and 1hour of exercise per week. The exercises and slides are all copied from last year - meaning you can just presolve stuff with solutions which makes the course even simpler. Additionally the exercise session can easily be skipped, especially if you solved the exercises already and understood it.Don't underestimate the amount you have to study for this subject tho. If you really want to understand the things and actually want to learn some of the biology and physic stuff this will take quite a while. However, the exam is quite unrewarding for studying. Most questions are about common sense. For example you have to literally interpret some graphs or eliminate obviously wrong answers. But the exam is also incredibly difficult to be good in. This is mostly because the other type of questions are as random as questions can be. They will ask you about definitions that never were fully given. They will ask you about random fact that they may or may not have said in the lecture etc. Also the exam basically didn't require any kind of calculation or sketchs and we had waaaaaay too much time.Also, there were no old exams etc... and even if there would have been some old ones, I doubt they would've helped to prepare us for the randomness of that exam.",
        "This isn't about the machine learning Neural Networks.The course offers a detailed view of the human brain, neurons and how computations in the brain happen and can be modelled. The course is overall not very demanding, although if you wish for an excellent grade you'll have to study a lot more by heart than what is typical for ETH. If you're only here for the credits, well, the exam is multiple choice without negative points, and most questions can be eliminated to a 50:50 by common sense.In my opinion, it's an interesting course in that it is very different from almost everything else you'll see in the CS curriculum.",
        "Introduction to Neuroinformatics is a course about biological neurons. If you\u2019re looking for a Neuronal Networks course, that\u2019s not the one. This course covers the anatomy of brains and neurons, the physical mechanisms of the neurons and towards the end also some abstractions to model biological computation. So the first part is really biology and the last few lectures are more about computer science related concepts. This course is overall relatively easy to follow. The topics are mostly covered on a high-school level. So they can be somewhat interesting but the individual concepts are not really hard to grasp. Furthermore, this course is split up into multiple somewhat connected parts taught by various lecturers. So if you should dislike a single topic/lecturer, it\u2019s nothing you have to endure for the entirety of the course. Unfortunately, it\u2019s quite unlikely that you\u2019ll be able to do anything with this course though - there are basically no other courses in this direction unless you\u2019re planning to switch to UZH.The exam is multiple choice which means that you can pass this course with good guessing. Unlike with ETH courses, you might have to learn a couple of things by heart for this course if you want to get a very good grade.  HS20",
        "Very free credits. The exam is only multiple-choice questions and the exercises aren't really relevent much. Most of it is just knowing things by heart, but a lot of questions can be solved with little knowledge just by eliminating obviously wrong answers.The topics are generally interesting though sometimes very detailled. There's also a wide range of different topics and not all are equally interesting. Most of the lecture is biology where you learn about the brain and neurons/synapses, so I'd recommend it only if you have some interest in biolgoy. The exercises are imo not very relevant to the course (I only did the first few and it was fine) and it's only 2 hours of lecture per week (+1 houre for discussing the exercise, but this can be skipped), so this subject consumes very little time during the semester. There are a bunch of different lectures for this course - some good, some bad - so don't abort just because there's a bad prof at the start."

Some of the algorithms like page-ranking you will encounter again.In General the Effort is not very high, attending the lecture is usually enoughSadly there is almost no possiblity (or it's very unhandy) to do something extra or doing something on your own, since it is very Theory based.As usual in GESS it is more about concepts and not about proofs.(Even tho it the concept are completly mathematical models)",

But quite easy to get a good grade, since the exams on Moodle are pretty much recycled and the in person exam was very similar to the one provided. The script pretty much covers the entire lecture which essentially means that you don't have to go to any lectures. However the lecture slides are sometimes somewhat confusing and the lecture itself is afaik always late...While its a boring course one cannot deny that you will actually learn a thing or two which is good for a gess course I guess?",

So it\u2019s a course that\u2019s made for all possible study programs about a topic that\u2019s quite central in CS. Some of the concepts are quite interesting. However, the lectures are quite late and combined with long explanations, it can sometimes be quite hard to focus. The material provided is unfortunately rather lacking in quality. A big issue is also the similar (or overlapping?) notation used for various concepts and the notation definitions are also sometimes lacking or missing. However, this course is still okay and feasible so if you\u2019d like to have a bit more Graph Theory, it\u2019s definitely a viable option.HS19",

But the lectures are not very interesting and I don't think people will not fall asleep when the lecture time is in the late afternoon (which was the case with me). For the exam, you have one old exam to prep and you don't have any exercises; on the one hand, less to do, on the other hand, it's hard to expect what will come in the exam. We had 3 tasks in mid- and 6 tasks in the endterm. Each task weighs 10P and the best 6 tasks will be counted as your grade by dividing the sum of gained points by 10. If you want to learn how to use graphs to solve some real-world problems, go ahead.",
        "You will encounter a few topics again which have been covered in A&D and A&W plus some more graph related stuff. It can get a bit boring at times but despite that you could do some pretty interesting data analysis with it. The exam is also really favourable. The 6 best tasks from the mid and end term are taken and if you for whatever reason still failed they won't forward the grade so the fail wont even show up (at least thats what they did when I took it)HS20"

If you enjoy history, you'll likely enjoy this subject (if it is ever offered again). The exam is rough, apparently quite a few had to re-take it.

There is little actionable information, it really is more designed to be a theoretical overview.

Supposedly they also grade you on the quality/quantity of questions you ask after another person's presentation, but I never saw them take any notes on any person's \"activity level\" (actually they themselves were sometimes on their phones during a presentation). One thing I didn't like is how intransparent they are with their grading process. You get your grade at the end of the semester with 0 explanation or room for discussion. The effort required depends a lot on what research paper you present. Here you can mark preferences but ultimately who presents which paper is somewhat random. How much did I learn? Not that much tbh. The seminar was very helpful to push myself to finally learn more about cloud computing, and I learned a lot from the paper I presented. However most of the presentations were not great and very hard to follow, so beyond my own paper I didn't really learn anything.Recommended for: you just want to check \"doing a seminar\" off your todo list.",

In the end every member of the group has to present  the project alone. The oral exam is less of a presentation (as suggested by the lecturers) but more a discussion of your project. The grading is really generous. The only complaint I have is that the organization seems rather chaotic  FS22",

You have 8 weeks in the semester (aka the 2 lecture hours) to work on the project you have to present in the exam phase to get graded. The only other guide lines you get is that you can do it in groups of 1 to 3 people.Summary: The course is interesting, I definitely recommend taking it as Erg\u00e4nzung if you're interested in mathematical optimization, but more information/guidelines on the project would have been helpful"

The two profs try to mix things up and there's usually at least one big discussion that tends to go off-topic into whatever topic the group feels like talking about. Yet sometimes it still was difficult to pay attention all the way through; luckily the content from the lecture aren't specific facts or similar that you have to learn, but concepts from economics & ecology which you can apply in your project.With regards to the project, you're able to do nearly whatever you want, as long as you can somehow tie it in with the lecture. This flexibility allows you to choose a topic that really interests you, but it also makes it more difficult to pick something suitable.The effort required to pass isn't very high for the 6 credits you get. You surely can put a lot of time into your project if you want to though. I liked the course because it was something totally different from any other course I had taken and I was really interested in the topics, but I would probably advise you not to choose it just for the cheap credits if you do not have any interest in the subjects covered - the 4 hour lecture and the project will become a drag then.FS22",

You don\u2019t have to visit the 4h lectures but I can only recommend you do. They areheld by two lecturers who, at times, have very different world views. As a result the lecture feels a bit like a podcast (in a good way). After they are done presenting their views and thoughts they will usually open up the discussion to the class.At the end you will have to write a paper in groups of 3-5 students and then present your findings to the class.

Technically, it builds on differential equations (Analysis 2 content) but you won\u2019t have to solve any differential equations for the exam. This course is about applied differential equations.
